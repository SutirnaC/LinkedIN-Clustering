The repository contains 2 files: GIF Code V02 which is R code file used to perform clustering and Experiment 2 which is the GIF created through R from the plots generated out of clustering.
You can create the GIF by running the same R Code.
You will have to add the path to your own local folder in the last line where the GIF file is being stored.
